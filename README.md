# Typical use case

You want Ninjadog to:

- Be served through the web
- Log events
- Download torrents through an RSS feed
- Monitor a folder on your harddrive for torrent files (recursively) and add them to qBitTorrent when found

To do this, run the following:

```
npm install -g ninjadog
npm install -g ninjadog-plugin-webserver
npm install -g ninjadog-plugin-logger
npm install -g ninjadog-plugin-qb
npm install -g ninjadog-plugin-qbfilemon
npm install -g ninjadog-plugin-rssfeed
```

The webserver plugin serves ninjadog on port 8585.

Then edit your settings.json file (with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)):

```
code %APPDATA%/ninjadog/settings.json
```

Then install ninjadog as a service:

```
ninjadog service install
```

Et voil√†!
